```

### Q8 (a) Use the read.csv() function to read the data into R. Call the loaded data college. Make sure that you have the directory set to the correct location for the data.


```{r A, echo=TRUE}

#install.packages("ISLR")
library(ISLR)
#data(College)
college <- read.csv("/Users/shubhangisrivastava/Documents/UIC Study material/IDS 575/Asg-1/College.csv")
```
### Q8.(b) Look at the data using the fix() function. 
```{r B, echo=TRUE}

rownames (college)=college[,1]
fix(college)
college=college[,-1]
fix(college)
```
### Q8.

### C1 Use the summary() function to produce a numerical summary of the variables in the data set.
```{r C1, echo=TRUE}
summary(college)
```
### C2 Use the pairs() function to produce a scatterplot matrix of the first ten columns or variables of the data. Recall that you can reference the first ten columns of a matrix A using A[,1:10].
```{r C2, echo=TRUE}
pairs(college[,1:10])
```

### C3 Use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Private.

```{r C3, echo=TRUE}
plot(college$Private,college$Outstate, xlab = "Private", ylab = "Outstate") 
```

### C4 Create a new qualitative variable, called Elite, by binning the Top10perc variable. We are going to divide universities into two groups based on whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school classes exceeds 50 %.Use the summary() function to see how many elite univer- sities there are. Now use the plot() function to produce side-by-side boxplots of Outstate versus Elite.
```{r C4, echo=TRUE}
Elite=rep("No",nrow(college))
Elite[college$Top10perc >50]="Yes"
Elite=as.factor(Elite)
college=data.frame(college ,Elite)
summary(college)
plot(college$Elite,college$Outstate)
```

### C5 Use the hist() function to produce some histograms with differing numbers of bins for a few of the quantitative vari- ables. Modifying the arguments to this function will divide the screen in other ways.

```{r C5, echo=TRUE}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
hist(college$Apps)
hist(college$Enroll)
hist(college$Accept)
hist(college$Outstate)
```

### C6 Continue exploring the data, and provide a brief summary of what you discover.

```{r C6A, echo=TRUE}
Expensive=rep("No",nrow(college))
Expensive[college$Outstate >18000]="Yes"
Expensive=as.factor(Expensive)
college=data.frame(college ,Expensive)
summary(college)
par(mfrow=c(1,3))
hist(college$Top10perc)
hist(college$Grad.Rate)
hist(college$Outstate)
```


**Interpretations from output :While exploring the data we got to know that 48 out of 777 colleges are very expensive.**

```{r C6B, echo=TRUE}
Best=rep("No",nrow(college))
Best[(college$Outstate<10000)&(college$Top10perc >50)&(college$Grad.Rate>70)]="Yes"
Best=as.factor(Best)
college=data.frame(college ,Best)
summary(college)

```


**Interpretations from output: While exploring the data ,we found out that the colleges having outstate fee<1000,Top 10 percent>50 and graduation rate >70 comes out be 6.These are the best 6 college to apply.**

### Q10 (a) To begin, load in the Boston data set. The Boston data set is part of the MASS library in R.How many rows are in this data set? How many columns? What do the rows and columns represent?

```{r 10A, echo=TRUE}

#install.packages("MASS")
library(MASS)
data("Boston")
nrow(Boston)
ncol(Boston)
head(Boston)
```
**Interpretations from output:
rows are 506
coloumns are 14
Here rows are representing 506 housing values in Boston and col have 14 predictors**

### Q10.(b) Make some pairwise scatterplots of the predictors (columns) in this data set. Describe your findings.
```{r 10B1, echo=TRUE}
#par(mfrow = c(2, 2))
plot(Boston$chas, Boston$age)
```
<br>**Interpretations from output:Older buildings are near river**
```{r 10B2, echo=TRUE}
plot(Boston$chas, Boston$lstat)
```
<br>
**Interpretations from output:Lower status population less near river**
```{r 10B3, echo=TRUE}
plot(Boston$chas, Boston$medv)
```


**Interpretations from output:homes are expensive near the charles river but expensive houses which are the outliers are far from river too**
  
### Q10.(c) Are any of the predictors associated with per capita crime rate? If so, explain the relationship.
```{r 10C1, echo=TRUE}
hist(Boston$crim)
```


**Interpretations from output:80 percent of the areas are crime free  and only about 20 percent of data falls under crime**
```{r 10C2, echo=TRUE}
plot(Boston$chas, Boston$crim)
```

**Interpretations from output:crime is far from river area**
```{r 10C3, echo=TRUE}
plot(Boston$chas, Boston$crim)
```


**Interpretations from output:crime is large near five boston deployment centers**

### Q10.(d) Do any of the suburbs of Boston appear to have particularly high crime rates? Tax rates? Pupil-teacher ratios? Comment on the range of each predictor.
```{r 10D1, echo=TRUE}
hist(Boston$crim)
```


**Interpretations from output:most cities have low crime rates,but there is a long tail.18 suburbs appear to have a crime rate > 20, reaching to above 80**
```{r 10D2, echo=TRUE}
hist(Boston$tax)
```


**Interpretations from output:there is huge gap between low tax rates and  peak at 660-680**
```{r 10D3, echo=TRUE}
hist(Boston$ptratio)
```


**Interpretations from output:skewed towards high ratios**


### Q10.(e) How many of the suburbs in this data set bound the Charles river?
```{r 10E, echo=TRUE}
nrow(Boston[Boston$chas == 1, ])
```


**Interpretations from output:35 suburbs**

### Q10.(f) What is the median pupil-teacher ratio among the towns in this data set?
```{r 10F, echo=TRUE}
median(Boston$ptratio)
```


**Interpretations from output:19.05**

### Q10.(g) Which suburb of Boston has lowest median value of owner- occupied homes? What are the values of the other predictors for that suburb, and how do those values compare to the overall ranges for those predictors? Comment on your findings.
```{r 10G1, echo=TRUE}
row.names(Boston[min(Boston$medv), ])
```


**Interpretations from output:5**
```{r 10G2, echo=TRUE}
range(Boston$tax)
```


**Interpretations from output:187-711**
```{r 10G3, echo=TRUE}
Boston[min(Boston$medv), ]$tax
```


**Interpretations from output:222**

### Q10.(h) In this data set, how many of the suburbs average more than seven rooms per dwelling? More than eight rooms per dwelling? Comment on the suburbs that average more than eight rooms per dwelling.
```{r 10H1, echo=TRUE}
summary(Boston$rm)
```
<br>
**Interpretations from output:Average is 6.2 rooms**
```{r 10H2, echo=TRUE}
nrow(Boston[Boston$rm > 7, ])
```

**Interpretations from output:64 houses with more than 7 rooms**
```{r 10H3, echo=TRUE}
nrow(Boston[Boston$rm > 8, ])
```

**Interpretations from output:13 houses with more than 8 rooms**
